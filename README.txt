This Python 3 code attempts to predict some stock S1 traded in the S&P 500 Index based on the evolution of nine stocks S2, ..., S10 traded in the Nikkei Index. Because the trading day in Japan ends earlier than in the United States, the assumption is made that variations in the Japanese returns have an impact in the American return S1. For simplicity, no autocorrelation (i.e., time-dependence), is included for any of the stocks and the adopted Support Vector Regression therefore treats the data as purely cross-sectional.
